# hacky
Went on a bit of a security/hacking binge a while back. `recon.py` was the script I wrote for starting recon on a target. 
Utilized the tools you see in there as well as others such as

`aquatone, Sublist3r, Burp Suite, dirsearch etc.`

In addition, `browse_urls.py` and `hashcrack.py` are a couple scripts I wrote. One for more quickly navigating through urls and annotating/flagging them, the other to perform some simple hashing enumeration.
