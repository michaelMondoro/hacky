# hacky
Went on a bit of a security/hacking binge a while back. `recon.py` was the script I wrote for starting recon on a target. 
Utilized the tools you see in there as well as others such as

`aquatone, Sublist3r, Burp Suite, dirsearch etc.` Didn't want/need to add all of the external tools. Just throw them into a search and they'll come up for you.

In addition, `browse_urls.py` and `hashcrack.py` are a couple scripts I wrote. One to allow for faster navigation through a list of urls and annotating/flagging them. The other to perform some simple hashing enumeration.
